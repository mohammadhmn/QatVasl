# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are provided on a best-effort basis for the latest code on `main`.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately instead of opening a public issue.

Include:

- vulnerability description
- impact
- reproduction steps or proof of concept
- affected commit/version

Until a private security contact is configured, open a GitHub issue with minimal detail and request a private channel for disclosure.

## Disclosure Process

- We will acknowledge receipt as soon as possible.
- We will triage and validate impact.
- We will coordinate a fix and publish details after remediation.
